v2.0.2
------
- Added support for GenericFieldDataHandler - a simple plug and play handler for other mods to use
- Fixed FissionFlowRadiator adding heat to the simulation instead of removing it

v2.0.1
------
- Disabled SSTU and FFT support (until I get time to work on it)
- Fixed some log messages that were not gated behind the DebugMode config setting
- Fixed ModuleCurvedSolarPanel being in the Generators instead of the Solar Panels category
- Consolidated Fission/Fusion reactor categories
- Categories are now configurable (see config for details)
- Some properties of handlers are now configurable (see config for details)
- Added support for FissionFlowRadiator as a Heat type (NFE/Kerbal Atomics)
- Fixed ModuleAternator not polling right in the VAB

v2.0.0
------
- Complete rebuild
- Mod now acts as a general power and thermal design tool as well as its previous functions
- Added toolbar icon to open a Vessel Systems Management window
- Vessel Systems Management Window
 - Allows player to view relevant Thermal and Electrical summary of the current vessel in VAB or flight
 - Electrical summary:
  - Shows whole-vessel power flows, separated into consumption and generation
  - VAB panel has a tool to simulate distance effects on solar panel efficiency
  - Estimates time to drain or time to charge batteries
  - Can drill down to part categories (eg. Solar Panels, Harvesters, etc)
  - Can drill down to individual parts
  - Handles these module types
   - Stock: ModuleDeployableSolarPanel, ModuleGenerator, ModuleResourceConverter, ModuleActiveRadiator, ModuleResourceHarvester, ModuleCommand, ModuleLight, ModuleDataTransmitter, ModuleEnginesFX, ModuleAlternator
   - NF Suite: ModuleCurvedSolarPanel, FissionGenerator, ModuleRadioisotopeGenerator, ModuleCryoTank, ModuleAntimatterTank, ModuleChargeableEngine, ModuleDeployableCentrifuge, DischargeCapacitor (partial)
   - RealBattery: RealBattery
   - Other: KopernicusSolarPanel
 - Thermal mode:
  - Shows whole-vessel core heat flows, separated into draw and generation
  - Can drill down to part categories (eg. Solar Panels, Harvesters, etc)
  - Can drill down to individual parts
  - NOTE: does not handle non-core heat(eg re-entry, engines, solar)
  - NOTE: does not make a distinction between adjacent-only radiators and full-vessel radiators
  - Handles relevant module types
   - Stock: ModuleCoreHeat (Passive heat only eg RTG), ModuleResourceConverter, ModuleActiveRadiator, ModuleResourceHarvester
   - NF Suite: FissionReactor, ModuleFusionCore
- Customize settings with DynamicBatteryStorageSettings.cfg

v1.4.2
------
- Fixed wrong .NET version

v1.4.1
------
- 1.7.x compatible

v1.4.0
------
- Standalone release, license change (MIT)
- 1.6.x compatible
